Linux Project: Basic Administration - Completed Steps
1. Project Objective:
Successfully learned and executed basic Linux operations.
Configured users, permissions, and directory structures.
Documented all actions and outcomes.
2. Steps Completed:
a. Creating Users and Groups:
Created a new group called admin_group for administrators.
Added two users, user1 and user2, to the group.
Set passwords for both users to ensure secure access.
b. Configuring Access Permissions:
Created a folder named /admin_folder, designated exclusively for the admin_group.
Assigned group ownership of the folder to admin_group.
Configured the folder's permissions so that only group members can read, write, and execute files within it.
c. Directory Structure:
Inside /admin_folder, created two subdirectories:
projects for project files.
backups for backup files.
Verified that both subdirectories inherit the same group permissions as the parent folder.
d. System Monitoring:
Checked the available disk space to ensure there was sufficient storage.
Reviewed the memory usage to monitor system performance.
Observed the list of currently running processes to understand system activity.
e. Network Verification:
Identified the system’s IP address to verify network configuration.
Tested the system’s Internet connectivity by successfully pinging a website.
3. Documentation File:
Created a text file named admin_project_notes.txt to record the project results, which includes:

Steps taken during the project.
Challenges faced, such as minor permission issues during folder setup.
Suggestions for improvement, like automating repetitive tasks and exploring advanced permission settings.
Outcome:
The project was successfully completed, resulting in:

A restricted folder with properly configured access for the admin_group.
An organized directory structure for projects and backups.
Basic system monitoring and network testing skills.
This setup ensures a functional and secure environment for administrative tasks.
